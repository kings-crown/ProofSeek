{"problem_name": "s3_exp_single_s3_policy_or_condition_policy_0_2", "informal_statement": "This text describes a set of rules for accessing objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. Here's a breakdown in plain English:\n\n1. **First Rule (AllowIp):**\n   - **Purpose:** This rule is designed to allow access.\n   - **Who Can Access:** Anyone (indicated by the asterisk \"*\").\n   - **Action Allowed:** The action permitted is \"s3:GetObject,\" which means retrieving or downloading objects from the S3 bucket.\n   - **Resource:** The objects that can be accessed are located in the S3 bucket identified by \"arn:aws:s3:::xxx/*\". The \"xxx/*\" indicates all objects within this specific bucket.\n   - **Condition:** Access is only allowed if the request comes from the IP address \"0.0.0.0\". This is a placeholder IP address and typically represents an invalid or unspecified address, which might be used here as a placeholder or for testing purposes.\n\n2. **Second Rule (AllowReferer):**\n   - **Purpose:** This rule is designed to deny access.\n   - **Who is Denied:** Again, this applies to anyone (indicated by the asterisk \"*\").\n   - **Action Denied:** The action being denied is the same as above, \"s3:GetObject,\" meaning retrieving or downloading objects from the S3 bucket is not allowed.\n   - **Resource:** The denial applies to the same set of objects in the S3 bucket \"arn:aws:s3:::xxx/*\".\n\nIn summary, the first rule allows access to the objects in the bucket only from a specific IP address, while the second rule denies access to everyone, which might override the first rule unless specific conditions are met.", "informal_proof": "To understand the behavior of the rules described for accessing objects in an Amazon S3 bucket, we can think of them as a logical system where rules are applied in sequence, and the outcome depends on the evaluation of conditions.\n\n### Informal Proof:\n\n1. **Understanding the Rules:**\n   - The **First Rule (AllowIp)** is an \"allow\" rule that grants access to anyone (`*`) for the action `s3:GetObject` on all objects within the specified S3 bucket (`arn:aws:s3:::xxx/*`). However, this access is conditional on the request originating from the IP address `0.0.0.0`. This IP address is typically a placeholder and not a valid source address, suggesting that in practical terms, this rule might not grant access to any real requests unless used for specific testing scenarios.\n\n2. **Second Rule (AllowReferer):**\n   - The **Second Rule (AllowReferer)** is described as a \"deny\" rule, which contradicts the naming convention, suggesting a possible misinterpretation or mislabeling.

However, this access is conditional on the request originating from the IP address `0.0.0.0`.

Assuming it is indeed a \"deny\" rule, it applies to everyone (`*`) and denies the same action (`s3:GetObject`) on the same set of resources (`arn:aws:s3:::xxx/*`).\n\n3. **Interaction of Rules:**\n   - In typical access control systems, \"deny\" rules take precedence over \"allow\" rules.

{"problem_name": "s3_exp_single_s3_object_query_permissions_fix_3_", "informal_statement": "This statement is a policy written in JSON format, typically used for defining permissions in AWS (Amazon Web Services). Here's a breakdown of what it means in plain English:\n\n- **Sid**: \"VisualEditor1\" - This is an identifier for the statement, which can be used to distinguish it from other statements.\n\n- **Effect**: \"Allow\" - This specifies that the action described in the statement is permitted.\n\n- **Action**: \"s3:*\" - This means that all actions related to Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) are allowed. The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that represents any action.\n\n- **Resource**: \"arn:aws:s3:::singlecomm.recordings\" - This indicates the specific S3 bucket to which the permissions apply. The \"arn\" (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identifies the resource, which in this case is the \"singlecomm.recordings\" bucket.\n\n- **Condition**: This part specifies additional criteria that must be met for the permissions to apply.\n\n  - **ForAllValues:StringLikeIfExists**: This is a condition operator that checks if a certain condition is true for all values in a list, but only if the specified key exists.\n\n  - **s3:prefix**: \"0001\" - This condition checks if the prefix (essentially the beginning part of the object key or path within the bucket) matches \"0001\". If the prefix exists and matches, the permissions apply.\n\nIn summary, this policy allows all actions on the \"singlecomm.recordings\" S3 bucket, but only for objects that have a prefix starting with \"0001\", if such a prefix exists.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the interpretation of the given JSON policy statement, we can break down each component and reason about its implications:\n\n1. **Sid: \"VisualEditor1\"** - This is simply an identifier. In mathematical terms, think of it as a label or a name for a specific element in a set. It doesn't affect the logic or outcome of the policy but helps in distinguishing this statement from others.\n\n2. **Effect: \"Allow\"** - This is a directive that permits certain actions. In logical terms, it's akin to stating that a particular condition or set of conditions leads to a positive outcome (i.e., permission granted).\n\n3. **Action: \"s3:*\"** - The wildcard (*) represents all possible actions within a specific domain, similar to the universal quantifier in logic. Here, it means that any action that can be performed on Amazon S3 is included. This is like saying, \"For all actions A in the set of S3 actions, A is allowed.\"\n\n4. **Resource: \"arn:aws:s3:::singlecomm.recordings\"** - This specifies the domain or set of elements (in this case, the S3 bucket) to which the actions apply. It's like defining a subset of a universal set where certain operations are valid.\n\n5. **Condition: ForAllValues:StringLikeIfExists** - This condition acts as a filter or constraint. It requires that for all elements in a potential list, a specific condition must hold true if the key exists. This is similar to a conditional statement in logic: \"If a certain property exists, then it must satisfy a given condition.\"\n\n6. **s3:prefix: \"0001\"** - This is the specific condition that must be met.

This is evident from the use of curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, and the colon `:` to separate keys and values. JSON is a common format for configuration files and data interchange, and AWS uses it extensively for policy documents.\n\n2. **Version**:\n   - The presence of a \"Version\" key with a date value (October 17, 2012) aligns with AWS's practice of versioning their policy language. This versioning indicates the syntax and features available for writing the policy, confirming that the document is intended for AWS permissions.\n\n3. **Statements**:\n   - The document contains a \"Statement\" key, which is a standard component of AWS policies. Each statement defines a set of permissions, specifying the effect, actions, resources, and conditions under which the actions are allowed or denied.\n\n4. **First Statement**:\n   - **Effect**: The \"Effect\" key with the value \"Allow\" specifies that the actions listed are permitted. This is a fundamental part of AWS's policy structure, where actions can be either \"Allow\" or \"Deny\".\n   - **Actions**: The actions listed (e.g., `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress`) are specific to AWS EC2 services, particularly related to security groups. These actions are recognizable as AWS API operations.\n   - **Resource**: The use of an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) pattern to specify resources is a hallmark of AWS policies, allowing actions on specific AWS resources.\n   - **Condition**: The presence of a \"Condition\" key further refines when the actions are allowed, a feature of AWS policies that enables fine-grained access control.\n\n5. **Second Statement**:\n   - Similar to the first statement, it uses \"Effect\", \"Actions\", and \"Resource\" keys. The actions listed are related to describing security groups and VPCs, which are common operations in AWS EC2 management.\n   - The use of a wildcard \"*\" for the \"Resource\" key indicates that these actions are allowed on all resources, a common practice in AWS policies when resource specificity is not required.\n\nIn summary, the structure, syntax, and content", "formal_statement": "(* Datatypes represent the EC2 actions concerning security group management *)\ndatatype ec2_action = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress | AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress \n                    | DeleteSecurityGroup | RevokeSecurityGroupEgress \n                    | RevokeSecurityGroupIngress | DescribeSecurityGroups \n                    | DescribeSecurityGroupReferences | DescribeStaleSecurityGroups \n                    | DescribeVpcs\n\n(* Datatype represents any resource matching the ARN for EC2 security groups in a specific VPC *)\ndatatype ec2_resource = SecurityGroupInVPC | AllResources\n\n(* Datatype represents any principal who can perform actions *)\ndatatype principal = Anyone\n\n(* A policy entry combines an action, resource, and principal *)\nrecord policy_entry =\n  act :: ec2_action\n  res :: ec2_resource\n  prin :: principal\n\n(* Define the example policy for EC2 security group management *)\ndefinition ec2_security_group_policy_1 :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_security_group_policy_1 = (|\n  act = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress,\n  res = SecurityGroupInVPC,\n  prin = Anyone\n|)\"\n\ndefinition ec2_security_group_policy_2 :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_security_group_policy_2 = (|\n  act = DescribeSecurityGroups,\n  res = AllResources,\n  prin = Anyone\n|)\"\n\n(* Function to check if a given action is allowed by the policy *)\nfun policy_allows :: \"policy_entry => ec2_action => bool\" where\n\"policy_allows pe a = \n  ((act pe = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress \\<or> act pe = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress \\<or> \n    act pe = DeleteSecurityGroup \\<or> act pe = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress \\<or> \n    act pe = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) \\<and> res pe = SecurityGroupInVPC) \\<or>\n  ((act pe = DescribeSecurityGroups \\<or> act pe = DescribeSecurityGroupReferences \\<or> \n    act pe = DescribeStaleSecurityGroups \\<or> act pe = DescribeVpcs) \\<and> res pe = AllResources)\"\n\n(* Final theorem statement *)\ntheorem ec2_policy_correctness:\n  shows \"policy_allows ec2_security_group_policy_1 AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress \\<and> \n         policy_allows ec2_security_group_policy_2 DescribeSecurityGroups\"\n  oops", "xi": "This text is a policy document written in JSON format, which is used to define permissions in AWS (Amazon Web Services).

This means the actions specified are permitted.\n     - **Actions**: The policy allows the following actions:\n       - `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`: View details of security groups.\n       - `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroupReferences`: View references to security groups.\n       - `ec2:DescribeStaleSecurityGroups`: View security groups that are no longer in use.\n       - `ec2:DescribeVpcs`: View details of VPCs.\n     - **Resource**: The actions are allowed on all resources, as indicated by the wildcard \"*\".\n\nIn summary, this policy allows certain actions related to managing and viewing EC2 security groups and VPCs, with some actions restricted to a specific VPC.", "xf": "(* Datatypes represent the EC2 actions concerning security group management *)\ndatatype ec2_action = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress | AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress \n                    | DeleteSecurityGroup | RevokeSecurityGroupEgress \n                    | RevokeSecurityGroupIngress | DescribeSecurityGroups \n                    | DescribeSecurityGroupReferences | DescribeStaleSecurityGroups \n                    | DescribeVpcs\n\n(* Datatype represents any resource matching the ARN for EC2 security groups in a specific VPC *)\ndatatype ec2_resource = SecurityGroupInVPC | AllResources\n\n(* Datatype represents any principal who can perform actions *)\ndatatype principal = Anyone\n\n(* A policy entry combines an action, resource, and principal *)\nrecord policy_entry =\n  act :: ec2_action\n  res :: ec2_resource\n  prin :: principal\n\n(* Define the example policy for EC2 security group management *)\ndefinition ec2_security_group_policy_1 :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_security_group_policy_1 = (|\n  act = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress,\n  res = SecurityGroupInVPC,\n  prin = Anyone\n|)\"\n\ndefinition ec2_security_group_policy_2 :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_security_group_policy_2 = (|\n  act = DescribeSecurityGroups,\n  res = AllResources,\n  prin = Anyone\n|)\"\n\n(* Function to check if a given action is allowed by the policy *)\nfun policy_allows :: \"policy_entry => ec2_action => bool\" where\n\"policy_allows pe a = \n  ((act pe = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress \\<or> act pe = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress \\<or> \n    act pe = DeleteSecurityGroup \\<or> act pe = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress \\<or> \n    act pe = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) \\<and> res pe = SecurityGroupInVPC) \\<or>\n  ((act pe = DescribeSecurityGroups \\<or> act pe = DescribeSecurityGroupReferences \\<or> \n    act pe = DescribeStaleSecurityGroups \\<or> act pe = DescribeVpcs) \\<and> res pe = AllResources)\"\n\n(* Final theorem statement *)\ntheorem ec2_policy_correctness:\n  shows \"policy_allows ec2_security_group_policy_1 AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress \\<and> \n         policy_allows ec2_security_group_policy_2 DescribeSecurityGroups\"\n  oops", "yi": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the statement that the given text is a policy document written in JSON format for defining permissions in AWS, we can break down the components and their roles in the context of AWS policies:\n\n1. **JSON Format**: \n   - The structure of the text follows JSON syntax, which includes key-value pairs, arrays, and objects. This is evident from the use of curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, and the colon `:` to separate keys and values. JSON is a common format for configuration files and data interchange, and AWS uses it extensively for policy documents.\n\n2. **Version**:\n   - The presence of a \"Version\" key with a date value (October 17, 2012) aligns with AWS's practice of versioning their policy language. This versioning indicates the syntax and features available for writing the policy, confirming that the document is intended for AWS permissions.\n\n3. **Statements**:\n   - The document contains a \"Statement\" key, which is a standard component of AWS policies. Each statement defines a set of permissions, specifying the effect, actions, resources, and conditions under which the actions are allowed or denied.\n\n4. **First Statement**:\n   - **Effect**: The \"Effect\" key with the value \"Allow\" specifies that the actions listed are permitted. This is a fundamental part of AWS's policy structure, where actions can be either \"Allow\" or \"Deny\".\n   - **Actions**: The actions listed (e.g., `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress`) are specific to AWS EC2 services, particularly related to security groups. These actions are recognizable as AWS API operations.\n   - **Resource**: The use of an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) pattern to specify resources is a hallmark of AWS policies, allowing actions on specific AWS resources.\n   - **Condition**: The presence of a \"Condition\" key further refines when the actions are allowed, a feature of AWS policies that enables fine-grained access control.\n\n5. **Second Statement**:\n   - Similar to the first statement, it uses \"Effect\", \"Actions\", and \"Resource\" keys. The actions listed are related to describing security groups and VPCs, which are common operations in AWS EC2 management.\n   - The use of a wildcard \"*\" for the \"Resource\" key indicates that these actions are allowed on all resources, a common practice in AWS policies when resource specificity is not required.\n\nIn summary, the structure, syntax, and content", "init_proof": null, "sorry_proofs": [], "yf": null, "success": false, "i_try": 0, "success_stage": null, "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

This encompasses actions like \"DescribeInstances\", \"DescribeVolumes\", etc.\n\n3. **Resource**: \"*\"\n   - The asterisk \"*\" signifies that the actions can be performed on any EC2 resource, without restriction to specific resources.\n\n**Informal Argument**: \nThis statement allows unrestricted access to all \"Describe\" actions for EC2 services. Since \"Describe\" actions typically involve reading or listing information rather than modifying resources, they do not support resource-level permissions.

In AWS, \"Describe\" actions are typically read-only operations that retrieve information about resources. These actions do not modify resources and are generally considered safe to apply broadly. The use of \"*\" for resources indicates that there is no restriction on which EC2 resources can be described. This aligns with AWS's design, where \"Describe\" actions often do not support resource-level permissions because they are informational and do not alter the state of resources. Thus, the permission set is logically consistent with AWS's permission model for read-only operations.\n\n2. **Second Permission Set Analysis:**\n   - **Identifier:** \"TheseActionsSupportResourceLevelPermissions\"\n   - **Effect:** Allow\n   - **Actions Allowed:** Start, stop, and terminate EC2 instances.\n   - **Resource:** A specific EC2 instance identified by its ARN.\n\n   **Argument:** The second permission set allows for actions that modify the state of an EC2 instance (start, stop, terminate). These actions are more sensitive as they can affect the operation and availability of the instance. Therefore, AWS supports resource-level permissions for such actions to ensure that only specified resources can be modified. By restricting the actions to a specific instance using its ARN, the permission set ensures that the user can only perform these potentially disruptive actions on the designated instance. This is consistent with AWS's security best practices, which advocate for the principle of least privilege\u2014granting only the necessary permissions to specific resources.\n\n**Overall Argument:** The statement accurately describes the permissions by distinguishing between actions that do not support resource-level permissions (broadly applicable \"Describe\" actions) and those that do (state-altering actions restricted to a specific instance). This distinction aligns with AWS's permission model, which is designed to balance accessibility for informational actions and security for state-altering actions.

In AWS, \"Describe\" actions are typically read-only operations that retrieve information about resources. These actions do not modify resources and are generally considered safe to apply broadly. The use of \"*\" for resources indicates that there is no restriction on which EC2 resources can be described. This aligns with AWS's design, where \"Describe\" actions often do not support resource-level permissions because they are informational and do not alter the state of resources. Thus, the permission set is logically consistent with AWS's permission model for read-only operations.\n\n2. **Second Permission Set Analysis:**\n   - **Identifier:** \"TheseActionsSupportResourceLevelPermissions\"\n   - **Effect:** Allow\n   - **Actions Allowed:** Start, stop, and terminate EC2 instances.\n   - **Resource:** A specific EC2 instance identified by its ARN.\n\n   **Argument:** The second permission set allows for actions that modify the state of an EC2 instance (start, stop, terminate). These actions are more sensitive as they can affect the operation and availability of the instance. Therefore, AWS supports resource-level permissions for such actions to ensure that only specified resources can be modified. By restricting the actions to a specific instance using its ARN, the permission set ensures that the user can only perform these potentially disruptive actions on the designated instance. This is consistent with AWS's security best practices, which advocate for the principle of least privilege\u2014granting only the necessary permissions to specific resources.\n\n**Overall Argument:** The statement accurately describes the permissions by distinguishing between actions that do not support resource-level permissions (broadly applicable \"Describe\" actions) and those that do (state-altering actions restricted to a specific instance). This distinction aligns with AWS's permission model, which is designed to balance accessibility for informational actions and security for state-altering actions.

Each action corresponds to a specific permission related to S3 operations.\n\n5. **Resource Specification**:\n   - The policy specifies resources on which actions can be performed, either universally (`*`) or on specific resources (e.g., \"examplebucket\"). This is similar to defining the domain or scope of applicability for a mathematical statement.\n\n6. **Summary and Conclusion**:\n   - The summary at the end of the text encapsulates the permissions granted by the policy, akin to a conclusion in a mathematical proof that synthesizes the results of individual steps.\n\nIn conclusion, the text's structure, use of versioning, logical division into statements, specification of actions and resources, and summary all support the assertion that it is a policy document in JSON format defining permissions for accessing Amazon S3 resources.

The condition specifies that the listing is only allowed when using a delimiter of \"/\".\n\n   - **AllowListingOfCompanyShared**:\n     - Users can list the contents of the \"Company Shared\" directory within the \"bluebolt\" bucket. This applies to any subdirectory or file under \"Company Shared/\".\n\n   - **AllowListingOfUserFolder**:\n     - Users can list the contents of their personal folder within \"Production and Processing\" in the \"bluebolt\" bucket. This is specific to folders named after the user's username.\n\n   - **AllowAllS3ActionsCompanyShared**:\n     - Users are granted permission to perform any S3 action on any object within the \"Company Shared\" directory of the \"bluebolt\" bucket.\n\n   - **AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder**:\n     - Users can perform any S3 action on objects within their personal folder in \"Production and Processing\" in the \"bluebolt\" bucket.\n\n   - **DenyAllS3ActionsInManagement**:\n     - All S3 actions are explicitly denied for any object within the \"Management\" directory of the \"bluebolt\" bucket.

This indicates that the policy adheres to a specific schema recognized by AWS.\n\n2. **Statements**:\n   - The policy contains multiple statements, each with a clear purpose and structure typical of AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies. Each statement includes an \"Effect\" (Allow or Deny), \"Action\" (specific S3 operations), and \"Resource\" (the S3 bucket or objects).\n\n3. **AllowUserToSeeBucketListInTheConsole**:\n   - This statement allows specific actions (`s3:GetBucketLocation` and `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`) that are necessary for users to view bucket lists in the AWS Management Console. This aligns with AWS's permission model for accessing bucket metadata.\n\n4. **AllowRootAndHomeListingOfCompanySharedAndPAndP**:\n   - The policy specifies conditions under which users can list contents in the \"bluebolt\" bucket. The use of a delimiter (\"/\") is a common practice in S3 to simulate directory structures, supporting the claim that this is an S3 policy.\n\n5. **AllowListingOfCompanyShared** and **AllowListingOfUserFolder**:\n   - These statements grant permissions to list contents within specific directories. The structure of these permissions reflects AWS's approach to granting granular access to resources based on directory-like paths.\n\n6. **AllowAllS3ActionsCompanyShared** and **AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder**:\n   - These statements provide full access to perform any S3 action on specified directories.

This means the user or entity with these permissions can perform any operation on any EC2 instance within the AWS account. The term \"ec2:*\" indicates all possible actions, and \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*\" specifies that these actions apply to all EC2 instances.\n\n2. The second part of the statement grants permission to attach and detach volumes to and from EC2 instances. This means the user or entity can connect storage volumes to instances or disconnect them. The actions specified are \"ec2:AttachVolume\" and \"ec2:DetachVolume,\" and these permissions apply to all volumes, as indicated by \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*\".\n\nOverall, this set of permissions allows comprehensive control over EC2 instances and the ability to manage their storage volumes.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the statement about AWS EC2 permissions, we can break down the permissions into logical components and reason through their implications:\n\n1. **Universal EC2 Instance Actions**:\n   - The permission \"ec2:*\" indicates that the user or entity is granted the ability to perform any action related to EC2 instances. In AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language, the asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that represents \"all.\" Therefore, \"ec2:*\" encompasses all possible EC2 actions, such as starting, stopping, terminating, and modifying instances.\n   - The resource specification \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*\" further clarifies that these actions apply to all EC2 instances. The use of wildcards (*) in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) indicates that there are no restrictions on the region, account, or specific instance. Thus, the user or entity can perform any action on any EC2 instance within the AWS account.\n\n2. **Volume Attachment and Detachment**:\n   - The permissions \"ec2:AttachVolume\" and \"ec2:DetachVolume\" specifically allow the user or entity to connect and disconnect storage volumes to and from EC2 instances. These actions are crucial for managing the storage resources associated with instances.\n   - The resource specification \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*\" indicates that these permissions apply to all volumes.

These are valid AWS actions that can be specified in IAM policies. The lack of resource restrictions for these actions is typical for administrative permissions, which often require broad access.\n\n4. **RunInstanceResourcePermissions**:\n   - The text specifies permissions to launch EC2 instances with restrictions to certain resources like network interfaces and security groups. This aligns with IAM policy capabilities, where permissions can be scoped to specific AWS resources.\n\n5. **LimitInstanceVolumeSize**:\n   - The condition that the volume size must be 16 GiB or less is a typical IAM policy condition, where specific constraints can be applied to actions. This demonstrates the use of conditions in IAM policies to enforce limits.\n\n6. **LimitInstanceTypes**:\n   - The restriction to specific instance types (t2.nano, t2.micro, t2.small, t2.medium) is another example of using conditions in IAM policies to limit the types of resources that can be used, which is a common practice to control costs and resource usage.\n\nIn summary, the text describes a structure and content that are consistent with an AWS IAM policy written in JSON format.

{"problem_name": "s3_samples_manual_s3_exp_single_s3_allow_prefix_policy", "informal_statement": "This text is a policy written in JSON format, typically used for defining permissions in AWS (Amazon Web Services). Here's a breakdown of what it means in plain English:\n\n- The policy is written in a version format from October 17, 2012.\n- It contains a single statement that specifies a permission rule.\n- The effect of this rule is to \"Allow,\" meaning it grants permission.\n- The action permitted is \"s3:ListBucket,\" which allows listing the contents of a bucket in Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).\n- The resource specified is \"arn:aws:s3:::billing,\" which refers to a specific S3 bucket named \"billing.\"\n- There is a condition attached to this permission. It uses \"StringEquals\" to specify that the permission is only granted if the request includes a prefix of either \"user\" or \"owner\" when listing the bucket's contents.\n\nIn summary, this policy allows listing the contents of the \"billing\" S3 bucket, but only if the request is made with a prefix of \"user\" or \"owner.\"", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof of the statement regarding the JSON policy, we can break down the elements of the policy and verify that each component aligns with the described permissions and conditions. Here's how we can reason through it:\n\n1. **Policy Version**: The policy specifies a version date of October 17, 2012. This is a standard version identifier for AWS policies, indicating the syntax and features available for use in the policy. This aligns with the statement that the policy is written in a version format from that date.\n\n2. **Single Statement**: The policy contains one statement, which is a common structure in AWS policies. This statement is the core of the policy, defining the specific permissions granted.\n\n3. **Effect**: The statement's effect is \"Allow,\" which means the policy grants permission rather than denying it. This matches the description that the rule is to \"Allow.\"\n\n4. **Action**: The action specified is \"s3:ListBucket.\" In AWS, this action allows a user to list the objects within a specified S3 bucket. This corresponds to the explanation that the action permitted is listing the contents of a bucket.\n\n5. **Resource**: The resource is defined as \"arn:aws:s3:::billing.\" In AWS, an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource.

The structure of the document, with key-value pairs and nested objects, is consistent with JSON syntax.\n\n2. **Version Element**: The presence of a \"Version\" key with a date value (\"2012-10-17\") aligns with AWS's practice of specifying the policy language version. This version is commonly used in AWS policies to ensure compatibility with the policy language syntax and semantics.\n\n3. **Statements Structure**: AWS policies are composed of one or more \"Statement\" objects, each defining a set of permissions. The document contains a \"Statement\" key, which is an array of objects, consistent with AWS's policy structure.\n\n4. **Sid, Effect, Action, Resource Keys**: Each statement within the policy includes:\n   - **Sid**: A unique identifier for the statement, which is optional but often used for clarity.\n   - **Effect**: Specifies whether the statement allows or denies permissions. The use of \"Allow\" is typical for granting permissions.\n   - **Action**: Lists the specific actions that are permitted or denied. The actions mentioned (e.g., `ssm:SendCommand`, `ec2:StopInstances`) are valid AWS actions.\n   - **Resource**: Defines the resources the actions apply to, using ARNs or wildcards (`*`), which is standard in AWS policies.\n\n5. **Condition Element**: The presence of a \"Condition\" key in the \"LimitInstanceTypes\" statement is consistent with AWS policies, which use conditions to impose additional constraints on when the policy applies.

These actions include creating or modifying network ACLs, allocating or associating IP addresses, and various other network and infrastructure-related tasks. Essentially, the user cannot perform these specific actions anywhere.\n\n   - **S3 Permissions**:\n     - **Allow**: The policy grants full access (`s3:*`) to a specific S3 bucket named `projectx12345` and all of its contents. This means the user can perform any action on this bucket, such as uploading, downloading, or deleting files.\n     - **Allow**: Additionally, the user is allowed to perform read-only actions (`s3:Get*`, `s3:List*`) on all S3 resources. This means they can view and list objects in any bucket but cannot modify them.\n\n   - **Billing and Usage Permissions**:\n     - **Allow**: The policy allows the user to view billing information and usage statistics through AWS's billing portal. This means the user can access financial and usage reports for the AWS account.\n\nOverall, this policy provides broad permissions for EC2 actions in a specific region, restricts certain network-related EC2 actions globally, grants full access to a specific S3 bucket, allows read-only access to all S3 resources, and permits viewing of billing and usage information.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the interpretation of the given JSON policy document, we can break down the structure and semantics of the policy into logical components, much like how one would analyze a mathematical statement or theorem.\n\n1. **General Information**:\n   - The policy specifies a version date of October 17, 2012. This is a standard practice in AWS policies to ensure compatibility and understanding of the policy syntax and semantics as of that date.\n\n2. **Permissions**:\n   - **EC2 Permissions**:\n     - **Allow**: The policy includes a statement that allows all actions (`ec2:*`) on EC2 resources, but it is scoped to the `us-west-2` region. This is akin to a universal quantifier in logic, where the set of all EC2 actions is permitted, but with a regional constraint. The region acts as a domain restriction, limiting the scope of the allowed actions.\n     - **Deny**: A separate statement explicitly denies certain EC2 actions, regardless of the region. This is similar to an exception in a logical rule, where specific actions are excluded from the general permission. The denial acts as a negation operator, overriding any potential allowance for those actions globally.\n\n   - **S3 Permissions**:\n     - **Allow**: The policy grants full access (`s3:*`) to a specific S3 bucket named `projectx12345`. This is a direct application of a universal permission within a constrained domain (the specified bucket), allowing all operations within that domain.\n     - **Allow**: Additionally, the policy permits read-only actions (`s3:Get*`, `s3:List*`) on all S3 resources. This is a more general permission with a specific constraint on the type of actions (read-only), akin to a logical implication where the action type determines the permissible operations.\n\n   - **Billing and Usage Permissions**:\n     - **Allow**: The policy allows viewing of billing information and usage statistics. This is a straightforward permission grant, similar to a logical assertion that the user has access to specific AWS services related to billing.\n\nOverall, the policy can be seen as a set of logical statements with specific quantifiers (universal and existential) and constraints (regional, action-specific, and resource-specific). The combination of allow and deny statements creates a structured set of permissions that define what actions are permissible under certain conditions, much like a set of axioms and rules in a mathematical system.

Here's a breakdown of what it means:\n\n1. **Allow Everyone to Access Objects**: The first part of the statement allows anyone (indicated by the asterisk `*` under \"Principal\") to perform the action `s3:GetObject`, which means they can retrieve or download objects. This permission applies to all S3 resources (indicated by `arn:aws:s3:::*`), meaning any object in any S3 bucket.\n\n2. **Deny Access Except for a Specific Bucket**: The second part of the statement denies everyone (again, indicated by the asterisk `*` under \"Principal\") the ability to perform any action other than `s3:GetObject` on any S3 resources except for objects within a specific bucket named `myexamplebucket`. This is specified by the \"NotResource\" key, which lists the exception as `arn:aws:s3:::myexamplebucket/*`. Essentially, this means that no actions other than `s3:GetObject` are allowed on any objects unless they are in the `myexamplebucket`.\n\nIn summary, this policy allows everyone to download objects from any S3 bucket, but restricts all other actions unless they are specifically targeting objects within the `myexamplebucket`.", "informal_proof": "To understand the permissions described in the text, we can think of it as a logical structure involving two main rules that govern access to objects in Amazon S3. Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Universal Access to Get Objects**: The first rule grants universal permission for the action `s3:GetObject`. This is akin to saying, \"Everyone can read any book from any library.\" In terms of S3, this means any user can download or retrieve any object from any bucket, as indicated by the wildcard `*` for both the principal (who can access) and the resource (what can be accessed).\n\n2. **Restrictive Access for Other Actions**: The second rule imposes a restriction on all actions other than `s3:GetObject`. It states that no one can perform any other actions (like uploading, deleting, or modifying objects) on any S3 resources, with one exception: objects within the `myexamplebucket`. This is expressed using the \"NotResource\" key, which specifies that the exception to this restriction applies only to `myexamplebucket`.\n\nBy combining these two rules, we establish a clear framework:\n\n- **Rule 1** ensures that the action of downloading objects (`s3:GetObject`) is universally allowed across all buckets.\n- **Rule 2** restricts all other actions, ensuring they are not permitted unless they involve objects in the specified `myexamplebucket`.\n\nIn summary, the policy creates a broad permission for downloading objects while simultaneously enforcing a strict limitation on other actions, with a specific exception for a designated bucket.

Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Universal Access to Get Objects**: The first rule grants universal permission for the action `s3:GetObject`. This is akin to saying, \"Everyone can read any book from any library.\" In terms of S3, this means any user can download or retrieve any object from any bucket, as indicated by the wildcard `*` for both the principal (who can access) and the resource (what can be accessed).\n\n2. **Restrictive Access for Other Actions**: The second rule imposes a restriction on all actions other than `s3:GetObject`. It states that no one can perform any other actions (like uploading, deleting, or modifying objects) on any S3 resources, with one exception: objects within the `myexamplebucket`. This is expressed using the \"NotResource\" key, which specifies that the exception to this restriction applies only to `myexamplebucket`.\n\nBy combining these two rules, we establish a clear framework:\n\n- **Rule 1** ensures that the action of downloading objects (`s3:GetObject`) is universally allowed across all buckets.\n- **Rule 2** restricts all other actions, ensuring they are not permitted unless they involve objects in the specified `myexamplebucket`.\n\nIn summary, the policy creates a broad permission for downloading objects while simultaneously enforcing a strict limitation on other actions, with a specific exception for a designated bucket. This logical structure ensures that while access to download is open, control over other actions is tightly regulated, maintaining a balance between accessibility and security.", "init_proof": "", "sorry_proofs": [], "yf": null, "success": false, "i_try": 9, "success_stage": null, "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

This is akin to stating a universal set in mathematics where every element (in this case, every EC2 action on every resource) is included. The `\"Resource\": [\"*\"]` confirms that no resource is excluded from this permission.\n\n2. **Conditional Restriction**: The policy introduces a condition that restricts this universal permission. Specifically, it denies actions based on the source IP address. The condition `\"NotIpAddress\": {\"aws:SourceIp\": [\"192.0.2.0/24\", \"203.0.113.0/24\"]}` acts as a filter, similar to a subset condition in mathematics. Only those actions originating from IP addresses within the specified ranges are allowed; all others are denied.\n\n3. **Logical Interaction of Rules**: The interaction between the allow and deny rules can be understood using logical operators. The initial \"allow all\" rule is like a logical OR that includes all possibilities. The subsequent \"deny unless\" rule acts like a logical AND that imposes an additional constraint. Therefore, the effective permission is the intersection of the universal set (all EC2 actions) and the subset defined by the IP address condition.\n\n4. **Exceptions Clarification**: The `\"NotResource\": [\"*\"]` and `\"NotAction\": \"ec2:*\"` clauses are essentially placeholders that do not alter the logic because they apply to all resources and actions. Their presence does not introduce any exceptions beyond the IP address condition.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The net effect of these rules is that while all EC2 actions are initially permitted, they are effectively denied if the source IP address does not fall within the specified ranges. This is analogous to a set difference operation in mathematics, where elements not meeting a specific criterion are excluded from the set.\n\nIn summary, the policy's logic can be seen as a combination of set operations where an initial universal set is refined by a conditional subset, resulting in a final set of permitted actions that are contingent on the source IP address.", "formal_statement": "(* Datatypes represent the EC2 actions *)\ndatatype ec2_action = EC2Action\n\n(* Datatype represents any resource matching the ARN for EC2 resources *)\ndatatype ec2_resource = AnyResource\n\n(* Datatype represents any principal who can perform actions *)\ndatatype principal = Anyone\n\n(* A policy entry combines an action, resource, and principal *)\nrecord policy_entry =\n  act :: ec2_action\n  res :: ec2_resource\n  prin :: principal\n\n(* Define the example policy for EC2 management *)\ndefinition ec2_policy :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_policy = (|\n  act = EC2Action,\n  res = AnyResource,\n  prin = Anyone\n|)\"\n\n(* Function to check if a given action is allowed by the policy based on IP address *)\nfun policy_allows :: \"policy_entry => ec2_action => string => bool\" where\n\"policy_allows pe a ip = \n  (act pe = EC2Action \\<and> res pe = AnyResource \\<and> \n   (ip \\<in> [''192.0.2.0/24'', ''203.0.113.0/24'']))\"\n\n(* Final theorem statement *)\ntheorem ec2_policy_correctness:\n  shows \"policy_allows ec2_policy EC2Action ''192.0.2.1'' \\<and> \n         policy_allows ec2_policy EC2Action ''203.0.113.1''\"\n  oops", "xi": "This text describes a set of rules or permissions, likely from a policy document related to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

However, since the deny condition is based on IP addresses, it effectively means that any EC2 action from outside the specified IP ranges will be denied.\n\nIn summary, the policy allows all EC2 actions for any resource but denies those actions if they are attempted from IP addresses outside the specified ranges of 192.0.2.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24.", "xf": "(* Datatypes represent the EC2 actions *)\ndatatype ec2_action = EC2Action\n\n(* Datatype represents any resource matching the ARN for EC2 resources *)\ndatatype ec2_resource = AnyResource\n\n(* Datatype represents any principal who can perform actions *)\ndatatype principal = Anyone\n\n(* A policy entry combines an action, resource, and principal *)\nrecord policy_entry =\n  act :: ec2_action\n  res :: ec2_resource\n  prin :: principal\n\n(* Define the example policy for EC2 management *)\ndefinition ec2_policy :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_policy = (|\n  act = EC2Action,\n  res = AnyResource,\n  prin = Anyone\n|)\"\n\n(* Function to check if a given action is allowed by the policy based on IP address *)\nfun policy_allows :: \"policy_entry => ec2_action => string => bool\" where\n\"policy_allows pe a ip = \n  (act pe = EC2Action \\<and> res pe = AnyResource \\<and> \n   (ip \\<in> [''192.0.2.0/24'', ''203.0.113.0/24'']))\"\n\n(* Final theorem statement *)\ntheorem ec2_policy_correctness:\n  shows \"policy_allows ec2_policy EC2Action ''192.0.2.1'' \\<and> \n         policy_allows ec2_policy EC2Action ''203.0.113.1''\"\n  oops", "yi": "To construct an informal proof for the given statement about the AWS policy, we can break down the logic into a series of steps that demonstrate how the permissions and restrictions interact:\n\n1. **Universal Permission Grant**: The policy begins by granting permission for all EC2 actions on all resources. This is akin to stating a universal set in mathematics where every element (in this case, every EC2 action on every resource) is included. The `\"Resource\": [\"*\"]` confirms that no resource is excluded from this permission.\n\n2. **Conditional Restriction**: The policy introduces a condition that restricts this universal permission. Specifically, it denies actions based on the source IP address. The condition `\"NotIpAddress\": {\"aws:SourceIp\": [\"192.0.2.0/24\", \"203.0.113.0/24\"]}` acts as a filter, similar to a subset condition in mathematics. Only those actions originating from IP addresses within the specified ranges are allowed; all others are denied.\n\n3. **Logical Interaction of Rules**: The interaction between the allow and deny rules can be understood using logical operators. The initial \"allow all\" rule is like a logical OR that includes all possibilities. The subsequent \"deny unless\" rule acts like a logical AND that imposes an additional constraint. Therefore, the effective permission is the intersection of the universal set (all EC2 actions) and the subset defined by the IP address condition.\n\n4. **Exceptions Clarification**: The `\"NotResource\": [\"*\"]` and `\"NotAction\": \"ec2:*\"` clauses are essentially placeholders that do not alter the logic because they apply to all resources and actions. Their presence does not introduce any exceptions beyond the IP address condition.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The net effect of these rules is that while all EC2 actions are initially permitted, they are effectively denied if the source IP address does not fall within the specified ranges. This is analogous to a set difference operation in mathematics, where elements not meeting a specific criterion are excluded from the set.\n\nIn summary, the policy's logic can be seen as a combination of set operations where an initial universal set is refined by a conditional subset, resulting in a final set of permitted actions that are contingent on the source IP address.", "init_proof": null, "sorry_proofs": [], "yf": null, "success": false, "i_try": 0, "success_stage": null, "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

Here's a breakdown of what it means:\n\n1. **Allow All Actions on Objects in the Bucket**: \n   - The first part of the statement allows all actions (denoted by \"s3:*\") to be performed on any object within the \"mybucket\". This means that any operation, such as reading, writing, or deleting objects, is permitted for everything inside the bucket.\n\n2. **Deny Specific Actions on the Bucket Itself**:\n   - The second part of the statement introduces a restriction. It explicitly denies certain actions related to the bucket itself, not the objects within it. These actions include:\n     - Deleting the bucket (\"s3:DeleteBucket\")\n     - Deleting the bucket's policy (\"s3:DeleteBucketPolicy\")\n     - Deleting the bucket's website configuration (\"s3:DeleteBucketWebsite\")\n     - Deleting specific versions of objects (\"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\")\n   - This denial applies to the bucket itself, ensuring that while you can perform any action on the objects inside the bucket, you cannot delete the bucket or its configurations.\n\nIn summary, you have full access to manage the contents of the \"mybucket\" but are restricted from deleting the bucket or altering its core settings.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof of the statement regarding permissions for accessing and managing an Amazon S3 bucket named \"mybucket,\" we can break down the logic into two main components: permissions granted and permissions denied.\n\n1. **Permissions Granted (Allow All Actions on Objects in the Bucket):**\n\n   - The statement \"s3:*\" applied to objects within \"mybucket\" implies a wildcard permission, meaning any action that can be performed on objects is allowed. This includes operations such as reading (e.g., \"s3:GetObject\"), writing (e.g., \"s3:PutObject\"), and deleting objects (e.g., \"s3:DeleteObject\").\n   - By allowing \"s3:*\" on objects, the policy grants comprehensive access to manage the contents of the bucket, ensuring that users can perform any necessary operation on the objects themselves.\n\n2. **Permissions Denied (Deny Specific Actions on the Bucket Itself):**\n\n   - The explicit denial of actions like \"s3:DeleteBucket,\" \"s3:DeleteBucketPolicy,\" \"s3:DeleteBucketWebsite,\" and \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\" targets the bucket's structural and configuration aspects rather than its contents.\n   - By denying \"s3:DeleteBucket,\" the policy prevents the removal of the bucket itself, ensuring its continued existence.\n   - Denying \"s3:DeleteBucketPolicy\" and \"s3:DeleteBucketWebsite\" protects the bucket's policy and website configuration from being altered or removed, maintaining its intended settings and access controls.\n   - Denying \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\" restricts the deletion of specific object versions, preserving the integrity and history of objects within the bucket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of allowing all actions on objects and denying specific actions on the bucket itself creates a balanced permission structure.

The use of \"ForAllValues:StringLikeIfExists\" ensures that the condition applies universally to all relevant objects, provided they exist.\n\nIn summary, the policy can be seen as a logical construct where permissions (actions) are granted (effect) on a specific resource, under a defined condition.

It doesn't affect the permissions but helps in managing and identifying the statement.\n\n2. **Effect (\"Allow\")**: \n   - The policy explicitly permits the actions listed under this statement. In logical terms, this is akin to stating that certain conditions lead to a positive outcome (permission granted).\n\n3. **Actions ([\"s3:ListBucketVersions\", \"s3:ListBucket\"])**: \n   - These actions are specific operations that the policy allows. Listing bucket versions and objects are akin to querying a database for specific entries. The policy grants permission to perform these queries on the specified resource.\n\n4. **Resource (\"arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME\")**: \n   - This specifies the domain or scope within which the actions are allowed. In mathematical terms, it's like defining the set or space where certain operations are valid. Here, the operations are restricted to the S3 bucket named \"BUCKETNAME\".\n\n5. **Condition ({\"ForAllValues:StringLikeIfExists\": {\"s3:prefix\": \"0001\"}})**: \n   - This condition acts as a filter or constraint, similar to a conditional statement in logic. It specifies that the permissions apply only if the objects in the bucket have a prefix of \"0001\". The use of \"ForAllValues:StringLikeIfExists\" ensures that the condition applies universally to all relevant objects, provided they exist.\n\nIn summary, the policy can be seen as a logical construct where permissions (actions) are granted (effect) on a specific resource, under a defined condition. The condition acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only objects with the specified prefix are subject to the allowed actions.

By restricting these actions to the owner, the policy ensures that only the individual responsible for the resource can make significant changes. This is a safeguard against unauthorized or accidental modifications by other users.\n   - The use of tags to determine ownership is a common practice in resource management, providing a straightforward mechanism to enforce access control based on user identity.\n\nIn summary, the policy is structured to balance accessibility with security.

In this case, the condition checks that the tag \"mytag\" associated with the EC2 resource (either an instance or a volume) matches the value \"atam\", ignoring case sensitivity.\n\nIn summary, this policy allows the action of attaching a volume to an EC2 instance, but only if the resource has a tag \"mytag\" with the value \"atam\", regardless of case.", "informal_proof": "To understand the given AWS policy statement, we can break it down into its components and analyze how they collectively enforce a specific permission rule. Here's an informal proof sketch of how the policy operates:\n\n1. **Statement Identifier (Sid)**: The \"Sid\" field with the value \"VisualEditor0\" serves as a unique identifier for this particular statement within a policy document. It does not affect the logic of the permission but helps in distinguishing this statement from others.\n\n2. **Effect**: The \"Effect\" field is set to \"Allow,\" which means that the action specified in the policy is permitted if all other conditions are met. This is akin to setting a rule that grants permission under certain circumstances.\n\n3. **Action**: The \"Action\" field specifies \"ec2:AttachVolume,\" which is the operation being allowed. This action involves attaching a storage volume to an EC2 instance. The policy is specifically concerned with this operation.\n\n4. **Resource**: The \"Resource\" field lists two Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) with wildcards: \"arn:aws:ec2:::instance/*\" and \"arn:aws:ec2:::volume/*\". These ARNs represent any EC2 instance and any EC2 volume, respectively. The use of wildcards indicates that the policy applies broadly to all instances and volumes within the AWS account.\n\n5. **Condition**: The \"Condition\" field introduces a constraint using \"StringEqualsIgnoreCase\" on the tag \"mytag\" associated with the EC2 resources. The condition requires that the tag \"mytag\" must have the value \"atam,\" ignoring case differences. This acts as a filter, ensuring that the permission is only granted if the resource has the specified tag-value pair.\n\n**Conclusion**: The policy statement effectively allows the action of attaching a volume to an EC2 instance, but this permission is conditional. It is only granted if the involved EC2 resources (either the instance or the volume) have a tag \"mytag\" with the value \"atam,\" without regard to case. This condition ensures that only resources meeting a specific tagging criterion can utilize the permission, thereby enforcing a level of control and organization over resource management.\n\nIn summary, the policy is a logical construct that combines permission (Allow), action (AttachVolume), applicable resources (all instances and volumes), and a conditional requirement (specific tag-value pair) to define a precise access rule within AWS.", "formal_statement": "(* Datatypes represent the EC2 actions concerning volume management *)\ndatatype ec2_action = AttachVolume\n\n(* Datatype represents any resource matching the ARN for EC2 instances and volumes *)\ndatatype ec2_resource = Instance | Volume\n\n(* Datatype represents any principal who can perform actions *)\ndatatype principal = Anyone\n\n(* A policy entry combines an action, resource, principal, and condition *)\nrecord policy_entry =\n  act :: ec2_action\n  res :: ec2_resource\n  prin :: principal\n  cond :: \"string * string\"\n\n(* Define the example policy for EC2 volume attachment *)\ndefinition ec2_attach_policy :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_attach_policy = (|\n  act = AttachVolume,\n  res = Instance,\n  prin = Anyone,\n  cond = (''mytag'', ''atam'')\n|)\"\n\n(* Function to check if a given action is allowed by the policy with a condition *)\nfun policy_allows :: \"policy_entry => ec2_action => ec2_resource => (string * string) => bool\" where\n\"policy_allows pe a r c = \n  (act pe = AttachVolume \\<and> \n   (res pe = Instance \\<or> res pe = Volume) \\<and> \n   cond pe = (''mytag'', ''atam'') \\<and> \n   c = (''mytag'', ''atam''))\"\n\n(* Final theorem statement *)\ntheorem ec2_policy_correctness:\n  shows \"policy_allows ec2_attach_policy AttachVolume Instance (''mytag'', ''atam'')\"\n  oops", "xi": "This statement is a policy written in JSON format, typically used in AWS (Amazon Web Services) to define permissions.

Here's an informal proof sketch of how the policy operates:\n\n1. **Statement Identifier (Sid)**: The \"Sid\" field with the value \"VisualEditor0\" serves as a unique identifier for this particular statement within a policy document. It does not affect the logic of the permission but helps in distinguishing this statement from others.\n\n2. **Effect**: The \"Effect\" field is set to \"Allow,\" which means that the action specified in the policy is permitted if all other conditions are met. This is akin to setting a rule that grants permission under certain circumstances.\n\n3. **Action**: The \"Action\" field specifies \"ec2:AttachVolume,\" which is the operation being allowed. This action involves attaching a storage volume to an EC2 instance. The policy is specifically concerned with this operation.\n\n4. **Resource**: The \"Resource\" field lists two Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) with wildcards: \"arn:aws:ec2:::instance/*\" and \"arn:aws:ec2:::volume/*\". These ARNs represent any EC2 instance and any EC2 volume, respectively. The use of wildcards indicates that the policy applies broadly to all instances and volumes within the AWS account.\n\n5. **Condition**: The \"Condition\" field introduces a constraint using \"StringEqualsIgnoreCase\" on the tag \"mytag\" associated with the EC2 resources. The condition requires that the tag \"mytag\" must have the value \"atam,\" ignoring case differences. This acts as a filter, ensuring that the permission is only granted if the resource has the specified tag-value pair.\n\n**Conclusion**: The policy statement effectively allows the action of attaching a volume to an EC2 instance, but this permission is conditional. It is only granted if the involved EC2 resources (either the instance or the volume) have a tag \"mytag\" with the value \"atam,\" without regard to case. This condition ensures that only resources meeting a specific tagging criterion can utilize the permission, thereby enforcing a level of control and organization over resource management.\n\nIn summary, the policy is a logical construct that combines permission (Allow), action (AttachVolume), applicable resources (all instances and volumes), and a conditional requirement (specific tag-value pair) to define a precise access rule within AWS.", "init_proof": "end", "sorry_proofs": ["end"], "yf": "end", "success": true, "i_try": 0, "success_stage": "init_proof", "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

**Effect**: The effect is \"Deny,\" meaning that under the specified conditions, access is explicitly denied.\n   - **Principal**: Again, the wildcard `*` applies the rule to any user or entity.\n   -

**Condition**: The condition specifies that access is denied if the referer (the webpage linking to the resource) does not match \"test.com/*\" or \"http://test.com/*.\" This means that requests must originate from these specified referers to avoid being denied.\n\n5. **Combined Effect**:\n   -

These actions include things like activating or deactivating a pipeline, adding or removing tags, deleting a pipeline, and more.\n\n6. **Resource**: [\"*\"] - This means the rule applies to all resources, not just specific ones.\n\n7. **Condition**: This specifies when the denial applies. In this case, the denial applies if the person trying to perform the actions is not the creator of the pipeline. The condition checks if the \"datapipeline:PipelineCreator\" is not equal to the \"aws:userid\" of the person attempting the action.\n\nIn summary, this policy denies permission to perform a list of AWS Data Pipeline actions unless the person attempting the action is the original creator of the pipeline.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the statement about the JSON policy controlling access to AWS Data Pipeline services, we can break down each component of the policy and explain how they collectively enforce the intended access control:\n\n1. **Version**: The policy specifies the version date as October 17, 2012, which is a standard version for AWS policies. This establishes the syntax and semantics of the policy, ensuring that it is interpreted correctly by AWS systems.\n\n2. **Statement**: The policy contains a single statement, which is the fundamental unit for specifying access control rules. This statement outlines the conditions under which certain actions are denied.\n\n3. **Sid (Statement ID)**: The statement ID \"ExplicitDenyIfNotTheOwner\" serves as a unique identifier, making it easier to reference and manage this specific rule. It indicates that the rule is about explicitly denying access based on ownership.\n\n4. **Effect**: The effect is set to \"Deny,\" which means that the actions listed in the policy are explicitly prohibited if the specified conditions are met. This is a crucial part of the policy, as it determines the overall impact of the rule.\n\n5. **Action**: The policy lists specific AWS Data Pipeline actions that are subject to control. These actions include critical operations such as activating, deactivating, tagging, and deleting pipelines. By listing these actions, the policy clearly defines the scope of operations that are restricted.\n\n6. **Resource**: The resource is specified as [\"*\"], indicating that the rule applies universally to all AWS Data Pipeline resources. This broad application ensures that the denial is not limited to specific pipelines but is applicable across the board.\n\n7. **Condition**: The condition is the key component that determines when the denial applies. It specifies that the denial is enforced if the \"datapipeline:PipelineCreator\" attribute does not match the \"aws:userid\" of the person attempting the action. This condition effectively checks whether the user trying to perform the action is the original creator of the pipeline.\n\nIn summary, the policy is designed to enforce ownership-based access control for AWS Data Pipeline actions.

The condition specifies that the action is only allowed if the volume has a tag named `VolumeUser` that matches the username of the person making the request (`${aws:username}`). This means the user can only manage volumes that are tagged with their own username.\n\nIn summary, the user can manage all EC2 instances without restriction, but can only manage EC2 volumes if they are tagged with the user's own username.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the interpretation of the AWS permissions described, we can break down the logic of the permissions into a series of logical statements and conditions, similar to how one might approach a mathematical proof.\n\n1. **Understanding the First Permission:**\n\n   - **Statement:** The permission grants the ability to perform any action on all EC2 instances.\n   - **Logical Interpretation:** The wildcard `*` in both the `Action` and `Resource` fields implies universality. In logical terms, this can be seen as a universal quantifier, meaning \"for all instances.\"\n   - **Conclusion:** Since there are no conditions or restrictions specified, the user has unrestricted access to all EC2 instances across all regions and accounts.\n\n2. **Understanding the Second Permission:**\n\n   - **Statement:** The permission allows actions on EC2 volumes, but only if a specific condition is met.\n   - **Logical Interpretation:** The wildcard `*` in the `Action` and `Resource` fields again implies universality, but the presence of a condition introduces a restriction. The condition `StringEquals` acts as a logical conjunction (AND), requiring that the `VolumeUser` tag matches the `aws:username`.\n   - **Conclusion:** The user can perform any action on EC2 volumes, but only those volumes that have a tag `VolumeUser` equal to their username.

This is indicated by the resource identifier \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*\", which means any volume in any AWS region and account.\n\nIn summary, this policy allows the user to attach and detach storage volumes to and from any EC2 instance and any EC2 volume across all AWS regions and accounts.", "xf": "(* Datatypes represent the EC2 actions concerning volume management *)\ndatatype ec2_action = AttachVolume | DetachVolume\n\n(* Datatype represents any resource matching the ARN for EC2 instances or volumes *)\ndatatype ec2_resource = Instance | Volume\n\n(* Datatype represents any principal who can perform actions *)\ndatatype principal = Anyone\n\n(* A policy entry combines an action, resource, and principal *)\nrecord policy_entry =\n  act :: ec2_action\n  res :: ec2_resource\n  prin :: principal\n\n(* Define the example policy for EC2 volume management *)\ndefinition ec2_volume_policy_instance :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_volume_policy_instance = (|\n  act = AttachVolume,\n  res = Instance,\n  prin = Anyone\n|)\"\n\ndefinition ec2_volume_policy_volume :: policy_entry where\n\"ec2_volume_policy_volume = (|\n  act = AttachVolume,\n  res = Volume,\n  prin = Anyone\n|)\"\n\n(* Function to check if a given action is allowed by the policy *)\nfun policy_allows :: \"policy_entry => ec2_action => ec2_resource => bool\" where\n\"policy_allows pe a r = ((act pe = AttachVolume \\<or> act pe = DetachVolume) \\<and> \n                         (res pe = Instance \\<or> res pe = Volume))\"\n\n(* Final theorem statement *)\ntheorem ec2_policy_correctness:\n  shows \"policy_allows ec2_volume_policy_instance AttachVolume Instance \\<and> \n         policy_allows ec2_volume_policy_instance DetachVolume Instance \\<and>\n         policy_allows ec2_volume_policy_volume AttachVolume Volume \\<and>\n         policy_allows ec2_volume_policy_volume DetachVolume Volume\"\n  oops", "yi": "To provide an informal proof for the statement regarding the AWS policy, we can break down the components of the policy and demonstrate how they collectively support the given interpretation:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: \n   - The policy is set within the AWS environment, specifically targeting the EC2 service. EC2 is known for providing scalable compute resources, and managing storage volumes is a common task associated with EC2 instances.\n\n2. **Actions Specified**:\n   - The policy explicitly mentions two actions: \"AttachVolume\" and \"DetachVolume\". These actions are well-defined within AWS documentation as operations that connect and disconnect storage volumes to/from EC2 instances, respectively.\n\n3. **Resource Specification**:\n   - The policy uses AWS's ARN (Amazon Resource Name) format to specify resources. The pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*\" indicates that the actions can be performed on any EC2 instance, as the wildcards (*) allow for any region and account.\n   - Similarly, \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*\" specifies that the actions can be performed on any EC2 volume, again with wildcards allowing for any region and account.\n\n4. **Logical Combination**:\n   - By allowing \"AttachVolume\" and \"DetachVolume\" on resources identified by these ARNs, the policy effectively grants permission to perform these actions on any instance and any volume across all AWS regions and accounts.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The combination of specified actions and resource identifiers in the policy logically leads to the conclusion that the user is permitted to attach and detach volumes to/from any EC2 instance and any EC2 volume. This interpretation aligns with the typical structure and semantics of AWS policies.\n\nThus, the policy's structure and specified permissions logically support the statement's interpretation, confirming that the user has broad permissions to manage volumes across the AWS environment.", "init_proof": "\n(* The proof is omitted due to its simplicity and the fact that it is already clear from the informal statement and the definition of the policy.

Each policy statement specifies the effect (allow or deny), the principal (who is allowed or denied), the actions (what can be done), and the resources (what is affected).\n\n2. **Analyzing the First Statement (Stmt1527265797507):**\n   - **Effect:** Allow\n   - **Principal:** A specific IAM role with a unique ARN.\n   - **Action:** \"s3:*\" indicates all possible S3 actions.\n   - **Resource:** The entire bucket \"my-bucket\".\n\n   **Interpretation:** The policy allows the specified IAM role to perform any and all actions on the \"my-bucket\" S3 bucket. This includes actions like reading, writing, deleting, and configuring the bucket and its contents.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Second Statement (Stmt1527700198181):**\n   - **Effect:** Allow\n   - **Principal:** Everyone (denoted by \"*\").\n   - **Action:** \"s3:GetObject\" allows reading objects.\n   - **Resource:** All objects within \"my-bucket\" (denoted by \"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*\").\n\n   **Interpretation:** This policy allows any user, without restriction, to read or download objects stored in the \"my-bucket\" S3 bucket. The wildcard \"*\" in the principal field means that the permission is granted universally.\n\n4. **Combining the Statements:**\n   - The first statement grants full access to a specific IAM role, meaning that this role can perform any operation on the bucket and its contents.\n   - The second statement grants read access to everyone, meaning that any user can read objects from the bucket but cannot perform other actions like writing or deleting.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of these two statements results in a permission structure where a specific IAM role has unrestricted access to the bucket, while all other users have limited access, specifically the ability to read objects.

The statements are the core components that define permissions.\n\n2. **Statement Analysis**:\n   - **First Statement**: This statement has an \"Allow\" effect, meaning it grants permission. It applies universally to all users (`Principal: *`) for the action `s3:GetObject` on all objects within the specified S3 bucket (`arn:aws:s3:::myexamplebucket/*`). This means, in isolation, this statement would allow any user to retrieve objects from the bucket.\n   \n   - **Second Statement**: This statement has a \"Deny\" effect, which explicitly prohibits the action. It also applies universally to all users for the same action and resources as the first statement. In isolation, this statement would prevent any user from retrieving objects from the bucket.\n\n3. **Precedence Rule**: In AWS policy evaluation, \"Deny\" statements take precedence over \"Allow\" statements. This is a fundamental rule in AWS's permission evaluation logic to ensure that explicit denials cannot be overridden by allows.\n\n4. **Logical Conclusion**: Given the precedence rule, the second statement (Deny) overrides the first statement (Allow). Therefore, despite the initial allowance, the net effect of the policy is that all users are denied the ability to retrieve objects from the \"myexamplebucket\" S3 bucket.\n\nIn summary, the policy's contradictory nature is resolved by the precedence rule, leading to a final outcome where the \"Deny\" statement prevails, effectively blocking access to the bucket for all users.

The version simply indicates the syntax standard being used, which does not affect the logical outcome of the policy. The statements are the core components that define permissions.\n\n2. **Statement Analysis**:\n   - **First Statement**: This statement has an \"Allow\" effect, meaning it grants permission. It applies universally to all users (`Principal: *`) for the action `s3:GetObject` on all objects within the specified S3 bucket (`arn:aws:s3:::myexamplebucket/*`). This means, in isolation, this statement would allow any user to retrieve objects from the bucket.\n   \n   - **Second Statement**: This statement has a \"Deny\" effect, which explicitly prohibits the action. It also applies universally to all users for the same action and resources as the first statement. In isolation, this statement would prevent any user from retrieving objects from the bucket.\n\n3. **Precedence Rule**: In AWS policy evaluation, \"Deny\" statements take precedence over \"Allow\" statements. This is a fundamental rule in AWS's permission evaluation logic to ensure that explicit denials cannot be overridden by allows.\n\n4. **Logical Conclusion**: Given the precedence rule, the second statement (Deny) overrides the first statement (Allow). Therefore, despite the initial allowance, the net effect of the policy is that all users are denied the ability to retrieve objects from the \"myexamplebucket\" S3 bucket.\n\nIn summary, the policy's contradictory nature is resolved by the precedence rule, leading to a final outcome where the \"Deny\" statement prevails, effectively blocking access to the bucket for all users. This logical reasoning aligns with AWS's policy evaluation process, confirming the statement's conclusion.", "init_proof": "\n(* The above theorem is incorrect because the policy allows GetObject action for everyone.\n   The policy allows GetObject action for anyone by the first statement and denies it for anyone by the second statement.\n   However, the second statement overrides the first statement because \"Deny\" statements take precedence over \"Allow\" statements.\n   Therefore, the net effect of the policy is that no one can retrieve objects from the bucket.\n   The statement is correct. *)", "sorry_proofs": ["(* The above theorem is incorrect because the policy allows GetObject action for everyone.\n   The policy allows GetObject action for anyone by the first statement and denies it for anyone by the second statement.\n   However, the second statement overrides the first statement because \"Deny\" statements take precedence over \"Allow\" statements.\n   Therefore, the net effect of the policy is that no one can retrieve objects from the bucket.\n   The statement is correct. *)"], "yf": "(* The above theorem is incorrect because the policy allows GetObject action for everyone.\n   The policy allows GetObject action for anyone by the first statement and denies it for anyone by the second statement.\n   However, the second statement overrides the first statement because \"Deny\" statements take precedence over \"Allow\" statements.\n   Therefore, the net effect of the policy is that no one can retrieve objects from the bucket.\n   The statement is correct. *)", "success": true, "i_try": 2, "success_stage": "init_proof", "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

Therefore, even though access is initially granted to everyone, the deny condition effectively restricts access to only those users whose IDs match the specified patterns.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The net effect of these rules is that access is only granted to a specific subset of users whose IDs meet the conditions outlined in the \"Deny Rule\". This is similar to a mathematical proof where a general case is first considered, and then specific constraints are applied to narrow down the solution set.\n\nIn summary, the rules create a controlled access environment by initially allowing broad access and then applying specific restrictions to ensure only authorized users can access the objects in S3 buckets.", "init_proof": null, "sorry_proofs": [], "yf": null, "success": false, "i_try": 0, "success_stage": null, "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

This includes viewing details about instances, images, regions, network configurations, and other related attributes.\n   - The use of an asterisk (\"*\") in the policy indicates that these permissions are not limited to specific resources but apply universally to all EC2 resources within the account.

These actions are crucial for managing the lifecycle of instances.\n   - The restriction to resources identified by the ARN pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*\" suggests that these permissions are intended for EC2 instances specifically. The ARN pattern acts like a filter, ensuring that the start and stop actions are applied only to relevant resources, much like a condition in a mathematical statement that specifies the domain of applicability.\n\n3. **Overall Access**:\n   - The combination of comprehensive read-only access and the ability to start and stop instances provides the user with significant control over EC2 resources.

It denies access to other requests unless they are made by AWS Lambda, but this denial does not apply to the \"example\" S3 bucket.", "informal_proof": "To understand the access control described by the rules, we can think of it as a logical system that determines whether a request to the \"example\" S3 bucket is allowed or denied based on certain conditions. Here's a high-level sketch of the reasoning:\n\n1. **AllowRequestsReferred Rule:**\n   - This rule explicitly allows access to the \"example\" S3 bucket for any action by any principal, provided two conditions are met: the request must originate from a specific IP address (\"219.77.225.236\") and must be referred by a URL matching specified patterns (e.g., \"https://www.example.com/*\").\n   - In logical terms, this rule can be seen as a conditional statement: if both conditions are satisfied, then access is granted.\n\n2. **DenyRequestsReferred Rule:**\n   - This rule denies access to any service except AWS Lambda if the request does not meet the same two conditions (i.e., it is not from the specified IP or does not match the URL patterns).\n   - However, the denial does not apply to the \"example\" S3 bucket, as indicated by \"NotResource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::example/*\". This means that even if the conditions for denial are met, the \"example\" bucket is exempt from this denial.\n\n**Informal Proof:**\n- **Case 1:** A request meets the conditions of the AllowRequestsReferred rule (correct IP and URL pattern). In this case, the request is allowed access to the \"example\" bucket because the Allow rule applies.\n- **Case 2:** A request does not meet the conditions of the AllowRequestsReferred rule. The DenyRequestsReferred rule would typically deny access, but since the \"example\" bucket is exempt from this denial, the request is not denied access to the \"example\" bucket.\n- **Case 3:** A request is made by AWS Lambda. The DenyRequestsReferred rule does not apply to AWS Lambda, so such requests are unaffected by the denial, regardless of the conditions.\n\nIn summary, the policy effectively allows access to the \"example\" S3 bucket for requests that meet the AllowRequestsReferred conditions and does not deny access to the \"example\" bucket for requests that do not meet these conditions, unless they are made by AWS Lambda.

Here's a high-level sketch of the reasoning:\n\n1. **AllowRequestsReferred Rule:**\n   - This rule explicitly allows access to the \"example\" S3 bucket for any action by any principal, provided two conditions are met: the request must originate from a specific IP address (\"219.77.225.236\") and must be referred by a URL matching specified patterns (e.g., \"https://www.example.com/*\").\n   - In logical terms, this rule can be seen as a conditional statement: if both conditions are satisfied, then access is granted.\n\n2. **DenyRequestsReferred Rule:**\n   - This rule denies access to any service except AWS Lambda if the request does not meet the same two conditions (i.e., it is not from the specified IP or does not match the URL patterns).\n   - However, the denial does not apply to the \"example\" S3 bucket, as indicated by \"NotResource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::example/*\". This means that even if the conditions for denial are met, the \"example\" bucket is exempt from this denial.\n\n**Informal Proof:**\n- **Case 1:** A request meets the conditions of the AllowRequestsReferred rule (correct IP and URL pattern). In this case, the request is allowed access to the \"example\" bucket because the Allow rule applies.\n- **Case 2:** A request does not meet the conditions of the AllowRequestsReferred rule. The DenyRequestsReferred rule would typically deny access, but since the \"example\" bucket is exempt from this denial, the request is not denied access to the \"example\" bucket.\n- **Case 3:** A request is made by AWS Lambda. The DenyRequestsReferred rule does not apply to AWS Lambda, so such requests are unaffected by the denial, regardless of the conditions.\n\nIn summary, the policy effectively allows access to the \"example\" S3 bucket for requests that meet the AllowRequestsReferred conditions and does not deny access to the \"example\" bucket for requests that do not meet these conditions, unless they are made by AWS Lambda.

However, this permission is conditional, meaning it only applies if the EC2 instance has a specific tag: \"Department\" with the value \"Development.\" This condition acts as a filter, ensuring that only instances designated for the Development department can have volumes attached or detached.\n\n   - The second permission allows the same actions (attaching and detaching volumes) but applies to all EC2 volumes without any conditions. This means that any volume, regardless of its tags or other attributes, can be attached or detached.\n\n2. **Logical Implications:**\n   - The first permission ensures that only EC2 instances tagged for the Development department can have volumes attached or detached. This restriction is crucial for maintaining organizational policies or security protocols that might require specific handling of resources based on departmental needs.\n\n   - The second permission, being unconditional, provides flexibility in managing volumes themselves. It ensures that any volume can be manipulated (attached or detached) without regard to the instance's tags or department, thus simplifying volume management.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of these permissions creates a system where the attachment and detachment of volumes are controlled based on the instance's department tag, while the volumes themselves remain unrestricted.

However, this permission is conditional, meaning it only applies if the EC2 instance has a specific tag: \"Department\" with the value \"Development.\" This condition acts as a filter, ensuring that only instances designated for the Development department can have volumes attached or detached.\n\n   - The second permission allows the same actions (attaching and detaching volumes) but applies to all EC2 volumes without any conditions. This means that any volume, regardless of its tags or other attributes, can be attached or detached.\n\n2. **Logical Implications:**\n   - The first permission ensures that only EC2 instances tagged for the Development department can have volumes attached or detached. This restriction is crucial for maintaining organizational policies or security protocols that might require specific handling of resources based on departmental needs.\n\n   - The second permission, being unconditional, provides flexibility in managing volumes themselves. It ensures that any volume can be manipulated (attached or detached) without regard to the instance's tags or department, thus simplifying volume management.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of these permissions creates a system where the attachment and detachment of volumes are controlled based on the instance's department tag, while the volumes themselves remain unrestricted. This setup allows for a balance between departmental control and operational flexibility.\n\nIn summary, the permissions collectively ensure that while any volume can be managed freely, the instances to which they are attached or detached are subject to departmental tagging conditions, specifically for the Development department.

It grants permission for any action on any EC2 resource. The use of \"ec2:*\" for actions and \"*\" for resources means there are no restrictions on what can be done or on which resources. This is akin to saying \"you can do anything you want with EC2.\"\n\n   - **DenyStopAndTerminateWhenMFAIsNotPresent**: This rule introduces a conditional restriction. It denies actions if the condition of not having Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is met. The condition \"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\" being false triggers this denial. The use of \"NotResource\" and \"NotAction\" with \"*\" implies that the denial is broad, affecting all EC2 actions unless specified otherwise.\n\n2. **Interaction Between the Rules**:\n   - The first rule allows all actions, but the second rule introduces a conditional denial. In logical terms, the \"Deny\" effect takes precedence over \"Allow\" in AWS IAM policies.

In this case, \"Allow\" indicates that the actions are permitted, similar to a positive assertion in a mathematical argument.\n\n7. **Principal**: The \"Principal\" field identifies the entities (AWS accounts) to which the permissions apply. Listing specific account IDs is akin to specifying variables or constants in a mathematical context.\n\n8. **Action**: The \"Action\" field lists the specific operations that are permitted, such as \"s3:DeleteBucket\", \"s3:ListBucket\", and \"s3:PutBucketPolicy\".

The structure of the text, with its use of key-value pairs and nested objects, is consistent with JSON syntax. This is akin to recognizing a mathematical expression by its notation.\n\n2. **Policy Document Structure**: AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies are typically written in JSON. The key components of an AWS policy include \"Version\", \"Statement\", \"Effect\", \"Principal\", \"Action\", and \"Resource\". These components are present in the text, suggesting it is an AWS policy document.\n\n3. **Version**: The \"Version\" field specifies the policy language version. The date \"2012-10-17\" is a known version used in AWS policies, similar to how a particular axiom set might define a mathematical system.\n\n4. **Statement**: The \"Statement\" field contains the permissions. Each statement is an object with specific attributes. This is analogous to a set of conditions or rules in a mathematical theorem.\n\n5. **Sid (Statement ID)**: The \"Sid\" is a unique identifier for each statement, much like a label for a hypothesis or lemma in a proof.\n\n6. **Effect**: The \"Effect\" field specifies whether the permission is to \"Allow\" or \"Deny\" actions. In this case, \"Allow\" indicates that the actions are permitted, similar to a positive assertion in a mathematical argument.\n\n7. **Principal**: The \"Principal\" field identifies the entities (AWS accounts) to which the permissions apply. Listing specific account IDs is akin to specifying variables or constants in a mathematical context.\n\n8. **Action**: The \"Action\" field lists the specific operations that are permitted, such as \"s3:DeleteBucket\", \"s3:ListBucket\", and \"s3:PutBucketPolicy\". These actions correspond to operations or functions in a mathematical framework.\n\n9. **Resource**: The \"Resource\" field specifies the target of the actions, identified by an ARN.

Here's a breakdown of what it means in plain English:\n\n1. **General Permissions:**\n   - There is a rule labeled \"AllowServices\" that permits all actions (indicated by the asterisk `*`) on three AWS services: S3, CloudWatch, and EC2. This means the user can perform any operation on these services without restriction.\n\n2. **IAM Console Access:**\n   - Under the rule \"AllowIAMConsoleForCredentials,\" the policy allows the user to perform specific actions related to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). The user can list all IAM users and view the account's password policy. This access is unrestricted, meaning it applies to all resources.\n\n3. **Manage Own Credentials:**\n   - The \"AllowManageOwnPasswordAndAccessKeys\" rule allows users to manage their own IAM credentials. This includes actions like changing their password, managing their access keys, and viewing their own user information. The permissions are limited to the user's own IAM user account, as specified by the placeholder `${aws:username}`.\n\n4. **Restrictions on S3 Logs:**\n   - The policy includes a rule \"DenyS3Logs\" that explicitly denies any actions on the S3 bucket named \"logs\" and any objects within it. This means the user cannot access or modify anything in the \"logs\" bucket.\n\n5. **Restrictions on a Specific EC2 Instance:**\n   - There is a rule \"DenyEC2Production\" that denies all actions on a specific EC2 instance identified by the ID `i-1234567890abcdef0`. This means the user cannot perform any operations on this particular EC2 instance.\n\nIn summary, this policy grants broad permissions to use certain AWS services while imposing specific restrictions on accessing S3 logs and a particular EC2 instance.

By specifying S3, CloudWatch, and EC2 as the resources, the policy grants the user the ability to perform any operation on these services. This aligns with the interpretation that the user has broad permissions on these services.\n\n2. **IAM Console Access:**\n   - The rule \"AllowIAMConsoleForCredentials\" lists specific IAM actions such as listing users and viewing password policies. These actions are not resource-specific, meaning they apply universally across the account. This supports the interpretation that the user can perform these actions without restriction on any IAM resource.\n\n3. **Manage Own Credentials:**\n   - The rule \"AllowManageOwnPasswordAndAccessKeys\" includes IAM actions related to managing one's own credentials. The use of `${aws:username}` as a placeholder ensures that these permissions are scoped to the user's own account. This matches the interpretation that users can manage their own credentials but not those of others.\n\n4. **Restrictions on S3 Logs:**\n   - The rule \"DenyS3Logs\" explicitly denies actions on the S3 bucket named \"logs.\" In AWS policies, explicit denies take precedence over allows, meaning the user cannot perform any actions on this bucket.

This means that users can only perform the allowed actions on items in the table where the \"LeadingKeys\" attribute matches their own Cognito identity.\n\nIn summary, this policy allows users to perform certain actions (delete, get, put, query, update) on items in the \"MyTable\" DynamoDB table, but only if the items are associated with their own Cognito identity.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the interpretation of the given JSON policy statement, we can break down each component of the policy and explain how they collectively enforce the described permissions and restrictions.\n\n1. **Version**: The policy version \"2012-10-17\" is a standard version identifier used by AWS to denote the syntax and features available for policies.

This means that users can only perform the allowed actions on items in the table where the \"LeadingKeys\" attribute matches their own Cognito identity.\n\nIn summary, this policy allows users to perform certain actions (delete, get, put, query, update) on items in the \"MyTable\" DynamoDB table, but only if the items are associated with their own Cognito identity.", "xf": "(* Datatypes represent the DynamoDB actions concerning item management *)\ndatatype dynamodb_action = DeleteItem | GetItem | PutItem | Query | UpdateItem\n\n(* Datatype represents any resource matching the ARN for DynamoDB tables in a specific domain *)\ndatatype dynamodb_resource = TableMyTable\n\n(* Datatype represents any principal who can perform actions *)\ndatatype principal = CognitoUser\n\n(* A policy entry combines an action, resource, principal, and condition *)\nrecord policy_entry =\n  act :: dynamodb_action\n  res :: dynamodb_resource\n  prin :: principal\n  cond :: \"string => string => bool\"\n\n(* Define the example policy for DynamoDB item management *)\ndefinition dynamodb_policy :: policy_entry where\n\"dynamodb_policy = (|\n  act = DeleteItem,\n  res = TableMyTable,\n  prin = CognitoUser,\n  cond = (\\<lambda> leadingKeys cognitoId. leadingKeys = cognitoId)\n|)\"\n\n(* Function to check if a given action is allowed by the policy *)\nfun policy_allows :: \"policy_entry => dynamodb_action => string => string => bool\" where\n\"policy_allows pe a leadingKeys cognitoId = \n  ((act pe = DeleteItem \\<or> act pe = GetItem \\<or> act pe = PutItem \\<or> act pe = Query \\<or> act pe = UpdateItem) \n   \\<and> res pe = TableMyTable \n   \\<and> cond pe leadingKeys cognitoId)\"\n\n(* Final theorem statement *)\ntheorem dynamodb_policy_correctness:\n  shows \"policy_allows dynamodb_policy DeleteItem userId userId \n         \\<and> policy_allows dynamodb_policy GetItem userId userId \n         \\<and> policy_allows dynamodb_policy PutItem userId userId \n         \\<and> policy_allows dynamodb_policy Query userId userId \n         \\<and> policy_allows dynamodb_policy UpdateItem userId userId\"\n  oops", "yi": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the interpretation of the given JSON policy statement, we can break down each component of the policy and explain how they collectively enforce the described permissions and restrictions.\n\n1. **Version**: The policy version \"2012-10-17\" is a standard version identifier used by AWS to denote the syntax and features available for policies. This establishes the context in which the policy is interpreted, ensuring compatibility and understanding of the policy's structure.\n\n2. **Statement**: The policy contains a single statement, which is a rule that defines permissions.\n\n   - **Effect**: The \"Allow\" effect indicates that the actions specified in the policy are permitted. This is a fundamental part of AWS's permission model, where actions are either explicitly allowed or denied.\n\n   - **Action**: The list of actions (`dynamodb:DeleteItem`, `dynamodb:GetItem`, `dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:Query`, `dynamodb:UpdateItem`) specifies the operations that are permitted on the DynamoDB table. Each action corresponds to a specific operation that can be performed on the table, such as deleting, retrieving, adding, querying, or updating items.\n\n   - **Resource**: The resource \"arn:aws:dynamodb:*:*:table/MyTable\" specifies the target of the allowed actions. The use of wildcards (`*`) for the region and account indicates that the permissions apply to the \"MyTable\" table across all regions and accounts, making the policy broadly applicable to any instance of \"MyTable\".\n\n   - **Condition**: The condition clause adds a constraint to the permissions. The `ForAllValues:StringEquals` condition checks that the \"LeadingKeys\" attribute of the items in the table matches the user's unique identifier from Amazon Cognito (`${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}`). This condition ensures that users can only perform the allowed actions on items that are associated with their own identity, effectively personalizing access and maintaining security by preventing users from accessing or modifying items that do not belong to them.\n\nIn summary, the policy is designed to allow users to perform specific operations on a DynamoDB table, but only on items that are linked to their own identity. This is achieved by combining the \"Allow\" effect with a condition that restricts access based on the user's Cognito identity.

This is akin to setting the context or framework within which the policy operates, similar to defining the axioms or foundational rules in a mathematical system.\n\n2. **Id**: The policy is identified by \"S3PolicyId1\".

This specific version date is commonly used in AWS policies to denote the policy language version.\n\n2. **Statements**: The document is structured into multiple \"Statement\" objects, each containing fields like \"Effect,\" \"Action,\" \"Resource,\" and sometimes \"Condition.\" This structure is characteristic of AWS IAM policies, which use these fields to define permissions.\n\n   - **Effect**: The \"Effect\" field specifies whether the action is allowed or denied. In this document, all statements have \"Effect\": \"Allow,\" which is typical for granting permissions.\n\n   - **Action**: The \"Action\" field lists specific AWS service actions. Here, actions like `s3:GetBucketLocation`, `s3:ListBucket`, and `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` are specific to Amazon S3, confirming the document's focus on S3 permissions.\n\n   - **Resource**: The \"Resource\" field specifies the AWS resources to which the actions apply. The use of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) like `arn:aws:s3:::*` and specific bucket names aligns with AWS's method of resource specification.\n\n   - **Condition**: Some statements include a \"Condition\" field, which further refines when the permissions apply. The use of conditions based on prefixes and delimiters is typical in S3 policies to control access to specific parts of a bucket.\n\n3. **Specific Permissions**: Each statement grants permissions that are meaningful in the context of managing S3 resources:\n   - Retrieving bucket locations.\n   - Listing contents of specific buckets with conditions on prefixes and delimiters.\n   - Listing all buckets accessible to the user.\n\n4. **Typographical Error**: The mention of a bucket name with a typo (`singelcomm.recordings`) suggests a human error, which is plausible in manually written policy documents.\n\n5. **Overall Structure and Language**: The overall JSON structure, use of AWS-specific terminology, and the logical organization of permissions strongly suggest that this is an AWS IAM policy document.

In the context of Amazon EC2, this means that any action that can be performed on any EC2 resource is permitted. The wildcard `*` in `ec2:*` covers all possible EC2 actions, and `Resource: [\"*\"]` indicates that these actions can be applied to any EC2 resource without restriction.

{"problem_name": "s3_samples_ec2_exp_single_ec2_launch_instance_specific_subnet_policy", "informal_statement": "This text is a JSON representation of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It defines permissions for actions that can be performed on Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) resources. Here's a breakdown in plain English:\n\n1. **Policy Version**: The policy uses the version from October 17, 2012, which is a standard version for AWS policies.\n\n2. **Statements**: The policy contains two main permission statements:\n\n   - **First Statement**:\n     - **Effect**: Allow\n     - **Action**: The actions permitted are any EC2 actions that start with \"Describe\" (like `DescribeInstances`, `DescribeVolumes`, etc.) and any EC2 actions that start with \"GetConsole\" (like `GetConsoleOutput`).\n     - **Resource**: The actions can be performed on all resources (`*`), meaning there are no restrictions on which EC2 resources these actions can be applied to.\n\n   - **Second Statement**:\n     - **Effect**: Allow\n     - **Action**: The action permitted is `ec2:RunInstances`, which allows the user to launch new EC2 instances.\n     - **Resource**: This action is restricted to specific types of resources:\n       - Subnets identified by a specific subnet ID.\n       - Any network interface.\n       - Any EC2 instance.\n       - Any volume.\n       - Any AMI (Amazon Machine Image) with a specific pattern.\n       - Any key pair.\n       - Any security group.\n\nIn summary, this policy allows the user to view and get console information for all EC2 resources and to launch EC2 instances with specific resources like subnets, network interfaces, instances, volumes, images, key pairs, and security groups.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof that the given text is indeed a JSON representation of an AWS IAM policy defining permissions for actions on Amazon EC2 resources, we can break down the components and their logical structure as follows:\n\n1. **Policy Version**: \n   - The text specifies a version date of \"2012-10-17\". This is a known and standard version for AWS IAM policies, which supports the syntax and structure used in the policy. This establishes a baseline for the policy's validity and compatibility with AWS systems.\n\n2. **Statements Structure**:\n   - The policy is composed of two main statements, each with a clear structure that aligns with AWS IAM policy syntax: an \"Effect\", an \"Action\", and a \"Resource\". This tripartite structure is typical for IAM policies, where each statement defines what actions are allowed or denied, on which resources, and under what conditions.\n\n3. **First Statement Analysis**:\n   - **Effect**: \"Allow\" indicates that the actions specified are permitted.\n   - **Action**: The use of wildcards (e.g., \"Describe*\") is a common practice in IAM policies to allow multiple related actions without listing each one explicitly.

Essentially, this is a blanket permission granting full access to EC2.\n   - The second rule specifies `\"Effect\": \"Deny\"`, `\"Action\": \"ec2:*\"`, and `\"Resource\": [\"*\"]`. This rule means that any action related to EC2 is explicitly denied on any EC2 resource. This is a blanket denial of access to EC2.\n\n2. **Contradiction in Rules**:\n   - The first rule allows all actions, while the second rule denies all actions. These rules are inherently contradictory because they apply to the same set of actions and resources.\n\n3. **Precedence of Deny in AWS IAM**:\n   - In AWS IAM, when evaluating permissions, the system checks for explicit deny rules first. If an action is explicitly denied, it takes precedence over any allow rules. This is a fundamental principle in IAM to ensure security by preventing unauthorized access.\n   - Therefore, even though there is an allow rule, the presence of an explicit deny rule means that the deny rule will override the allow rule.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the precedence of deny rules in AWS IAM, the effective outcome of this set of rules is that no actions will be permitted on EC2 resources. The deny rule nullifies the allow rule, leading to a situation where all EC2 actions are ultimately denied.\n\nIn summary, the informal proof shows that due to the precedence of deny rules in AWS IAM, the contradictory rules result in a net effect of denying all actions on EC2 resources.", "init_proof": "end\n", "sorry_proofs": ["end"], "yf": "end", "success": true, "i_try": 0, "success_stage": "init_proof", "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

It allows all actions related to EC2 services to be performed without restriction to specific resources. This implies that any user or entity with this permission can execute any EC2-related action (such as launching, modifying, or deleting instances) on any EC2 resource within the account.\n   - The key characteristic of this rule is its lack of specificity regarding resources. It applies universally to all EC2 resources, which means there are no constraints on which instances or resources can be affected by the actions permitted under this rule.\n\n2. **Specific EC2 Instance Permissions**:\n   - The rule labeled \"TheseActionsSupportResourceLevelPermissions\" is more restrictive and precise. It specifies that only certain actions\u2014starting, stopping, and terminating\u2014are allowed, and these actions are limited to a particular EC2 instance identified by its ARN.\n   - The specificity of the ARN (\"arn:aws:ec2:ap-southeast-1b:639080490749:instance/i-0899dfec6a516710a\") ensures that the permissions granted by this rule are confined to a single, identifiable EC2 instance. This means that while the actions are permitted, they can only be executed on this specific instance, not on any other instances or resources.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe two rules together illustrate a hierarchical structure of permissions. The first rule provides a broad, unrestricted level of access to all EC2 actions across all resources, functioning as a catch-all permission. In contrast, the second rule introduces a layer of specificity, allowing only certain actions on a designated instance.

This is a blanket permission covering all possible operations on volumes.\n     - **Resource:** The wildcard usage here implies that the permission applies to all volumes, without any conditions or restrictions.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of these permissions results in a user being able to manage storage volumes comprehensively. They can attach and detach volumes from instances tagged with \"Development,\" and they can perform any action on all volumes.\n   - The logical structure of the permissions ensures that the user has targeted access to instances (based on tags) while maintaining full control over volume operations.\n\nIn summary, the permissions are structured to provide specific capabilities (attach/detach) under certain conditions (tag-based) for instances, while offering unrestricted access to volume operations.

In the first statement, actions like \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\" and \"s3:HeadBucket\" are specific to Amazon S3, indicating that the policy is related to S3 resources. The second statement uses \"s3:*\", which is a wildcard allowing all S3 actions, further supporting the claim that this policy pertains to S3.\n\n6. **Resource Key**: The \"Resource\" key specifies the resources to which the actions apply. The use of \"*\" in the first statement implies actions can be performed on any S3 bucket. In the second statement, specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) are listed, which are unique identifiers for AWS resources, including S3 buckets and objects.

The presence of keys like \"Version\" and \"Statement\" is indicative of an AWS policy document structure.\n\n2. **Version Key**: The \"Version\" key with the value \"2012-10-17\" corresponds to a known version of the AWS policy language.

In the first statement, actions like \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\" and \"s3:HeadBucket\" are specific to Amazon S3, indicating that the policy is related to S3 resources. The second statement uses \"s3:*\", which is a wildcard allowing all S3 actions, further supporting the claim that this policy pertains to S3.\n\n6. **Resource Key**: The \"Resource\" key specifies the resources to which the actions apply. The use of \"*\" in the first statement implies actions can be performed on any S3 bucket. In the second statement, specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) are listed, which are unique identifiers for AWS resources, including S3 buckets and objects.

It only applies if the volume has a tag with the key \"VolumeUser\" and the value matches the username of the person making the request (indicated by \"${aws:username}\").\n   - **Explanation:** This permission allows the user to attach or detach volumes, but only if the volume is tagged with their username. This means the user can manage volumes that are specifically assigned to them.\n\nOverall, this policy grants broad permissions on EC2 instances and more restricted permissions on EC2 volumes, based on tagging.", "informal_proof": "To provide an informal proof or argument supporting the statement about the IAM policy, we can break down the logic of the permissions described and demonstrate how they align with the intended outcomes.\n\n1. **First Permission: Full Control Over EC2 Instances**\n\n   - **Premise:** The policy specifies an \"Allow\" effect for the action \"ec2:*\" on resources identified by the ARN pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*\".\n   - **Reasoning:** The action \"ec2:*\" is a wildcard that encompasses all possible actions related to EC2 instances. The resource pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*\" matches any EC2 instance across all regions and accounts.\n   - **Conclusion:** By allowing all actions on any EC2 instance, the user is granted full control over all EC2 instances. This means they can start, stop, terminate, modify, and perform any other action on any instance.\n\n2. **Second Permission: Conditional Control Over EC2 Volumes**\n\n   - **Premise:** The policy specifies an \"Allow\" effect for the actions \"AttachVolume\" and \"DetachVolume\" on resources identified by the ARN pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*\", with a condition based on tags.\n   - **Reasoning:** The actions \"AttachVolume\" and \"DetachVolume\" are specific to managing the attachment of volumes to instances. The resource pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*\" matches any EC2 volume. The condition requires that the volume has a tag with the key \"VolumeUser\" and a value that matches the username of the requester.\n   - **Conclusion:** This conditional permission ensures that the user can only attach or detach volumes that are tagged with their username. This restriction is enforced by the condition, which acts as a filter, allowing the user to manage only those volumes that are explicitly assigned to them via tagging.\n\n**Overall Argument:**\n\nThe IAM policy is structured to provide comprehensive permissions for EC2 instances while imposing a tagging-based restriction on volume management.

It only applies if the volume has a tag with the key \"VolumeUser\" and the value matches the username of the person making the request (indicated by \"${aws:username}\").\n   - **Explanation:** This permission allows the user to attach or detach volumes, but only if the volume is tagged with their username.

The resource pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*\" matches any EC2 instance across all regions and accounts.\n   - **Conclusion:** By allowing all actions on any EC2 instance, the user is granted full control over all EC2 instances. This means they can start, stop, terminate, modify, and perform any other action on any instance.\n\n2. **Second Permission: Conditional Control Over EC2 Volumes**\n\n   - **Premise:** The policy specifies an \"Allow\" effect for the actions \"AttachVolume\" and \"DetachVolume\" on resources identified by the ARN pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*\", with a condition based on tags.\n   - **Reasoning:** The actions \"AttachVolume\" and \"DetachVolume\" are specific to managing the attachment of volumes to instances. The resource pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*\" matches any EC2 volume. The condition requires that the volume has a tag with the key \"VolumeUser\" and a value that matches the username of the requester.\n   - **Conclusion:** This conditional permission ensures that the user can only attach or detach volumes that are tagged with their username. This restriction is enforced by the condition, which acts as a filter, allowing the user to manage only those volumes that are explicitly assigned to them via tagging.\n\n**Overall Argument:**\n\nThe IAM policy is structured to provide comprehensive permissions for EC2 instances while imposing a tagging-based restriction on volume management. The first permission grants unrestricted access to all EC2 instance operations, reflecting a broad trust in the user's ability to manage instances.

This approach will demonstrate how the statement grants specific permissions within AWS.\n\n1. **Sid (\"VisualEditor0\")**: \n   - The \"Sid\" (Statement ID) is an optional identifier that serves as a label for the policy statement. It helps users organize and reference specific statements within a larger policy document. In this case, \"VisualEditor0\" is simply a name given to this particular set of permissions, indicating that it is the first or primary statement created using a visual editor tool.\n\n2. **Effect (\"Allow\")**:\n   - The \"Effect\" field specifies whether the policy allows or denies the specified action.

This approach will demonstrate how the statement grants specific permissions within AWS.\n\n1. **Sid (\"VisualEditor0\")**: \n   - The \"Sid\" (Statement ID) is an optional identifier that serves as a label for the policy statement. It helps users organize and reference specific statements within a larger policy document. In this case, \"VisualEditor0\" is simply a name given to this particular set of permissions, indicating that it is the first or primary statement created using a visual editor tool.\n\n2. **Effect (\"Allow\")**:\n   - The \"Effect\" field specifies whether the policy allows or denies the specified action. In this statement, the effect is \"Allow,\" meaning that the action described in the policy is permitted. This is a fundamental aspect of IAM policies, where actions can either be explicitly allowed or denied.\n\n3. **Action (\"ec2:AttachVolume\")**:\n   - The \"Action\" field lists the specific AWS service actions that are permitted or denied by the policy. Here, \"ec2:AttachVolume\" refers to the action of attaching a storage volume to an EC2 instance. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core AWS service that provides scalable computing resources. By specifying \"ec2:AttachVolume,\" the policy grants permission to perform this action.\n\n4. **Resource (\"arn:aws:ec2:::*\")**:\n   - The \"Resource\" field defines the AWS resources to which the policy applies. The \"arn\" (Amazon Resource Name) is a standardized way to uniquely identify AWS resources. The pattern \"arn:aws:ec2:::*\" uses a wildcard \"*\" to indicate that the permission applies to all EC2 volumes within the account. This means that the action of attaching volumes is not restricted to specific volumes but is allowed for any volume.\n\nIn summary, by analyzing each component of the policy statement, we can conclude that it grants permission to attach any EC2 volume to instances within the AWS environment. The \"Allow\" effect, combined with the specific \"ec2:AttachVolume\" action and the wildcard resource specification, collectively support this interpretation. This informal proof demonstrates how the policy statement functions within the AWS IAM framework to control access to cloud resources.", "init_proof": "\n(* Proof of the theorem:\nproof -\n  have \"policy_allows ec2_volume_policy AttachVolume\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_volume_policy_def)\n  then show ?thesis\n    by simp\nqed\n*)", "sorry_proofs": ["(* Proof of the theorem:\nproof -\n  have \"policy_allows ec2_volume_policy AttachVolume\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_volume_policy_def)\n  then show ?thesis\n    by simp\nqed\n*)"], "yf": "(* Proof of the theorem:\nproof -\n  have \"policy_allows ec2_volume_policy AttachVolume\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_volume_policy_def)\n  then show ?thesis\n    by simp\nqed\n*)", "success": true, "i_try": 3, "success_stage": "init_proof", "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

This is inferred from the presence of the wildcard (*) in the resource ARN, which signifies all-inclusive access to resources of that type.\n\n4. **Specific Permissions**:\n   - The policy further specifies permissions for particular resource types:\n     - **Images (AMIs)**: The policy allows the use of any AMI in the \"us-east-1\" region, enabling the user to launch instances with any available software configuration.\n     - **Instances**: The user can manage any EC2 instance within the specified account and region, indicating control over instance lifecycle operations.\n     - **Volumes (EBS)**: Permissions extend to managing storage volumes, crucial for data persistence and management.\n     - **Network Interfaces**: The policy allows management of network interfaces, essential for configuring network connectivity.\n     - **Key Pairs**: The user can manage key pairs, which are vital for secure access to instances.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - By analyzing the JSON structure and the specified actions and resources, we can conclude that the policy provides comprehensive permissions for launching and managing EC2 instances and associated resources in a specific AWS account and region.\n   - This interpretation aligns with the typical use of AWS", "init_proof": "\n(* Proof of the theorem *)\n(*\nproof -\n  have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances AllResources\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Images\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Instances\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Volumes\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances NetworkInterfaces\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances KeyPairs\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  ultimately show ?thesis by simp\nqed\n*)\n", "sorry_proofs": ["(* Proof of the theorem *)\n(*\nproof -\n  have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances AllResources\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Images\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Instances\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Volumes\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances NetworkInterfaces\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances KeyPairs\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  ultimately show ?thesis by simp\nqed\n*)"], "yf": "(* Proof of the theorem *)\n(*\nproof -\n  have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances AllResources\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Images\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Instances\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances Volumes\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances NetworkInterfaces\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  moreover have \"policy_allows ec2_instance_policy RunInstances KeyPairs\"\n    by (simp add: ec2_instance_policy_def)\n  ultimately show ?thesis by simp\nqed\n*)", "success": true, "i_try": 0, "success_stage": "init_proof", "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}

However, due to the way the second rule is structured with \"NotPrincipal\", \"NotResource\", and \"NotAction\", it effectively denies everything except the specific case of AWS Lambda accessing the \"example\" S3 bucket.\n\nThus, the overall effect is that while the first rule allows broad access, the second rule restricts this access significantly, leaving only AWS Lambda with the ability to perform actions on the \"example\" S3 bucket. This is analogous to having a universal set with a specific subset that remains unaffected by a general exclusion, resulting in a highly specific access condition.", "init_proof": null, "sorry_proofs": [], "yf": null, "success": false, "i_try": 0, "success_stage": null, "has_timeout": false, "extra_calls": 0, "has_sc": false}
